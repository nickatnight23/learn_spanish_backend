Spanish practicing app

This app is used to practice spanish words. The first step is to enter a title associated with the topic. 
For example, if you choose the category verb the appropriate title would be something like past tense or future tense
for the verb. Once you choose the title enter the content in the following text box. If you selected verb as your category
then you could enter something like "cantar-to sing". After you enter in the content you can select create and that will save your
information into the database, which then will display on the screen. 

My intention for this app is to have a space to build knowledge about spanish words. Typing words daily
so that I can began to store the words in my memory bank.
